## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. This includes learning and adapting to new information, recognizing patterns, understanding natural language, and making decisions based on data.

AI can be categorized into two main types:

1. **Narrow AI:** This type of AI is designed to perform a specific task, such as voice recognition or image analysis.
2. **General AI:** This type of AI is capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do. It is also referred to as ""strong AI"" or ""artificial general intelligence"" (AGI).

Some of the key techniques used in AI include machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics.

### Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from data. This can be done through supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or reinforcement learning.

### Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This includes tasks such as speech recognition, language translation, and sentiment analysis.

### Robotics

Robotics involves the use of machines to perform physical tasks. This can include anything from manufacturing and assembly to search and rescue missions.

Overall, AI has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives, including healthcare, education, and transportation. However, it also raises important ethical and societal questions that need to be addressed.
